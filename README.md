# Materials for Modeling Travel and Importations on Bioko Island

This repository contains the code and documentation which support the data analysis and computer simulations for the publication "Quantifying malaria acquired during travel and its role in malaria elimination on Bioko Island" by Daniel T. Citron et al.

The supporting data which accompanies this code may be found **here**.

The R code inside the **scripts** folder is used to preprocess and analyze the data.

  * (Explanation of order to run scripts) 

The R code insde the **simulation_configurations** folder serves as example code which maybe used to generate a single simulation run for each of the different types of simulations.
